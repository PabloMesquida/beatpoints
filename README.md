# Beatpoints

Beatpoints is a music streaming web application built using React, React Three Fiber, and Styled Components for the graphical user interface. This project uses a 3D representation that is synchronized with the music playback. The graphical component's shape, color, and position change in response to the data received from the Spotify Web API.

It should be noted that using Beatpoints requires a premium Spotify account since some of the API features used are only available to premium subscribers.

Additionally, Beatpoints displays information about the artist, album, and song, as well as a karaoke-style lyrics visualization.
