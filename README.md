# Beatpoints

Beatpoints is a Spotify clone made with React, React Three Fiber, and Styled Components. This project has a 3D graphical representation that syncs with the music. What does this mean? The component changes its shape, color, and position in response to the information it receives from the Spotify API.

Please note that to use Beatpoints, you'll need to have a Spotify Premium account since some API features are only available to premium subscribers. If you're not a premium subscriber, don't worry! You can still explore the source code and see how the project works.

But that's not all, you can also see information about the artist, album, and song, and enjoy a karaoke-style lyrics visualization.

#### These are some of the libraries used in the project:
- **React:** The most popular JavaScript library for creating user interfaces.
- **React Three Fiber:** Allows you to create complex and beautiful 3D graphics in React.
- **Drei:** Utilities for React Three Fiber.
